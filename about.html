    <h1>About Jingjin Shi</h1>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Jingjin Shi, a 17-year-old junior at Farmington High School. 
        I've always loved to draw, and have accumulated a large collection of both finished and incomplete artworks over the years. 
        In addition, I also developed an interest in computer science and programming, taking lessons outside of school and coding various apps and games for fun. 
        I enjoy listening to music as well as joining my friends in playing mobile games. 
    </p>
